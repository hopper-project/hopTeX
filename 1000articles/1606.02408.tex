\begin{abstract}\noindent
Let $G$ be a permutation group on $n<\infty$ objects. Let $f(g)$ be the number of fixed points of $g\in G$, and let $\{f(g):1\ne g\in G\}=\{f_1,\ldots,f_r\}$. In this expository note we give a character-free proof of a theorem of Blichfeldt which asserts that the order of $G$ divides $(n-f_1)\ldots(n-f_r)$. We also discuss the sharpness of this bound.

Let us consider a permutation group $G$ on a finite set $\Omega$ consisting of $n$ elements. By Lagrange's Theorem applied to the symmetric group on $\Omega$, it follows that the order $|G|$ of $G$ is a divisor of $n!$. In order to strengthen this divisibility relation we denote the number of fixed points of a subgroup $H\le G$ on $\Omega$ by $f(H)$. Moreover, let $f(g):=f(\langle g\rangle)$ for every $g\in G$. In 1895, Maillet~\cite{Maillet} proved the following (see also Cameron's book \cite[p.~172]{Cameron}).

\begin{Theorem}[Maillet]
Let $\{f(H):1\ne H\le G\}=\{f_1,\ldots,f_r\}$. Then $|G|$ divides $(n-f_1)\ldots(n-f_r)$.
\end{Theorem}

Using the newly established character theory of finite groups, Blichfeldt~\cite{Blichfeldt} showed in 1904 that it suffices to consider cyclic subgroups $H$ in Maillet's Theorem (this was rediscovered by Kiyota~\cite{KiyotaBlich}).

\begin{Theorem}[Blichfeldt]\label{blich}
Let $\{f(g):1\ne g\in G\}=\{f_1,\ldots,f_r\}$. Then $|G|$ divides $(n-f_1)\ldots(n-f_r)$.
\end{Theorem}

For the convenience of the reader we present the elegant argument which can be found in \cite[Theorem~6.5]{Cameron}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Blichfeldt's Theorem]
Since $f$ is the permutation character, the function $\psi$ sending $g\in G$ to $(f(g)-f_1)\ldots(f(g)-f_r)$ is a generalized character of $G$ (i.\,e. a difference of ordinary complex characters). From
\[\psi(g)=\begin{cases}
(n-f_1)\ldots(n-f_r)&\text{if }g=1,\\0&\text{if }g\ne 1
\end{cases}\]
we conclude that $\psi$ is a multiple of the regular character $\rho$ of $G$. In particular, $\rho(1)=|G|$ divides $\psi(1)=(n-f_1)\ldots(n-f_r)$.
\end{proof}

It seems that no elementary proof (avoiding character theory) of Blichfeldt's Theorem has been published so far. The aim of this note is to provide such a proof.

\begin{proof}[Character-free proof of Blichfeldt's Theorem]
It suffices to show that
\[\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}(f(g)-f_1)\ldots(f(g)-f_r)\in\mathbb{Z},\]
since all summands with $g\ne 1$ vanish. Expanding the product we see that it is enough to prove
\[F_k(G):=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}{f(g)^k}\in\mathbb{Z}\]
for $k\ge 0$. Obviously, $F_0(G)=1$. Arguing by induction on $k$ we may assume that $F_{k-1}(H)\in\mathbb{Z}$ for all $H\le G$. Let $\Delta_1,\ldots,\Delta_s$ be the orbits of $G$ on $\Omega$, and let $\omega_i\in\Delta_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,s$. For $\omega\in\Delta_i$ the stabilizers $G_\omega$ and $G_{\omega_i}$ are conjugate in $G$. In particular, $F_{k-1}(G_\omega)=F_{k-1}(G_{\omega_i})$. Recall that the orbit stabilizer theorem gives us $|\Delta_i|=|G:G_{\omega_i}|$ for $i=1,\ldots,s$. This implies
\begin{align*}
F_k(G)&=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{\omega\in\Omega}\sum_{g\in G_\omega}{f(g)^{k-1}}=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{\omega\in\Omega}|G_\omega|F_{k-1}(G_\omega)=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{i=1}^s\sum_{\omega\in\Delta_i}|G_\omega|F_{k-1}(G_\omega)\\
&=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{i=1}^s|\Delta_i||G_{\omega_i}|F_{k-1}(G_{\omega_i})=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{i=1}^s|G:G_{\omega_i}||G_{\omega_i}|F_{k-1}(G_{\omega_i})=\sum_{i=1}^sF_{k-1}(G_{\omega_i})\in\mathbb{Z}.\qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

As a byproduct of the proof we observe that $F_1(G)$ is the number of orbits of $G$. This is a well-known formula sometimes (inaccurately) called Burnside's Lemma (see \cite{Burnsidenot}). If there is only one orbit, the group is called \emph{transitive}. In this case, $F_2(G)$ is the \emph{rank} of $G$, i.\,e. the number of orbits of any one-point stabilizer.

It is known that Blichfeldt's Theorem can be improved by considering only the fixed point numbers of non-trivial elements of prime power order. This can be seen as follows. Let $S_p$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ for every prime divisor $p$ of $|G|$. Since 
\[\{f(g):1\ne g\in S_p\}\subseteq\{f(g):1\ne g\in G\text{ has prime power order}\}=\{f_1,\ldots,f_r\},\] 
Theorem~\ref{blich} implies that $|S_p|$ divides $(n-f_1)\ldots(n-f_r)$ for every $p$. Since the orders $|S_p|$ are pairwise coprime, also $|G|=\prod_p|S_p|$ is a divisor of $(n-f_1)\ldots(n-f_r)$. On the other hand, it does not suffice to take the fixed point numbers of the elements of prime order. An example is given by $G=\langle(1,2)(3,4),(1,3)(2,4),(1,2)(5,6)\rangle$. This is a dihedral group of order $8$ where every involution moves exactly four letters.

Cameron-Kiyota~\cite{CamKiy} (and independently Chillag~\cite{Chillag}) obtained another generalization of Theorem~\ref{blich} where $f$ is assumed to be any generalized character $\chi$ of $G$ and $n$ is replaced by its degree $\chi(1)$. 
A dual version for conjugacy classes instead of characters appeared in Chillag~\cite{Chillag2}.

Numerous articles addressed the question of equality in Blichfeldt's Theorem. Easy examples are given by the \emph{regular} permutation groups. These are the transitive groups whose order coincides with the degree. In fact, by Cayley's Theorem every finite group is a regular permutation group acting on itself by multiplication. A wider class of examples consists of the \emph{sharply $k$-transitive} permutation groups $G$ for $1\le k\le n$. Here, for every pair of tuples $(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k),(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k)\in\Omega^k$ with $\alpha_i\ne\alpha_j$ and $\beta_i\ne\beta_j$ for all $i\ne j$ there exists a unique $g\in G$ such that $\alpha_i^g=\beta_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,k$. Setting $\alpha_i=\beta_i$ for all $i$, we see that any non-trivial element of $G$ fixes less than $k$ points. Hence,
\[\{f(g):1\ne g\in G\}\subseteq\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}.\]
On the other hand, if $(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k)$ is fixed, then there are precisely $n(n-1)\ldots(n-k+1)$ choices for $(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k)$. It follows that $|G|=n(n-1)\ldots(n-k+1)$. Therefore, we have equality in Theorem~\ref{blich}. Note that sharply $1$-transitive and regular are the same thing. 
An interesting family of sharply $2$-transitive groups comes from the \emph{affine groups}
\[{\operatorname{Aff}}(1,p^m)=\{{\varphi}:\mathbb{F}_{p^m}\to\mathbb{F}_{p^m}\mid\exists a\in\mathbb{F}_{p^m}^\times,b\in\mathbb{F}_{p^m}:{\varphi}(x)=ax+b\ \forall x\in\mathbb{F}_{p^m}\}\]
where $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$ is the field with $p^m$ elements.
More generally, all sharply $2$-transitive groups are \emph{Frobenius groups} with abelian kernel. By definition, a Frobenius group $G$ is transitive and satisfies $\{f(g):1\ne g\in G\}=\{0,1\}$. 
The \emph{kernel} $K$ of $G$ is the subset of fixed point free elements together with the identity. Frobenius Theorem asserts that $K$ is a (normal) subgroup of $G$. For the sharply $2$-transitive groups this can be proved in an elementary fashion (see \cite[Exercise~1.16]{Cameron}), but so far no character-free proof of the full claim is known.
The dihedral group $\langle(1,2,3,4,5),(2,5)(3,4)\rangle$ of order $10$ illustrates that not every Frobenius group is sharply $2$-transitive.

A typical example of a sharply $3$-transitive group is ${\operatorname{SL}}(2,2^m)$ with its natural action on the set of one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^2$. We leave this claim as an exercise for the interested the reader.
The sharply $k$-transitive groups for $k\in\{2,3\}$ were eventually classified by Zassenhaus~\cite{Zassenhaus1,Zassenhaus2} using near fields (see Passman's book~\cite[Theorems~20.3 and 20.5]{Passmanbook}). 
On the other hand, there are not many sharply $k$-transitive groups when $k$ is large. In fact, there is a classical theorem by Jordan~\cite{Jordan} which was supplemented by Mathieu~\cite{Mathieu}.

\begin{Theorem}[Jordan, Mathieu]
The sharply $k$-transitive permutation groups with $k\ge 4$ are given as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item the symmetric group of degree $n\ge 4$ \textup{(}$k\in\{n,n-1\}$\textup{)},
\item the alternating group of degree $n\ge 6$ \textup{(}$k=n-2$\textup{)},
\item the Mathieu group of degree $11$ \textup{(}$k=4$\textup{)},
\item the Mathieu group of degree $12$ \textup{(}$k=5$\textup{)}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Theorem}

We remark that the Mathieu groups of degree $11$ and $12$ are the smallest members of the \emph{sporadic} simple groups.

In accordance with these examples, permutation groups with equality in Theorem~\ref{blich} are now called \emph{sharp} permutation groups (this was coined by Ito-Kiyota~\cite{ItoK}).
Apart from the ones we have already seen, there are more examples. For instance, the symmetry group of a square acting on the four vertices has order $8$ (again a dihedral group) and the non-trivial fixed point numbers are $0$ and $2$. Recently, Brozovic~\cite{Brozovic} gave a description of the primitive sharp permutation groups $G$ such that $\{f(g):1\ne g\in G\}=\{0,k\}$ for some $k\ge 1$. Here, a permutation group is \emph{primitive} if it is transitive and any one-point stabilizer is a maximal subgroup. The complete classification of the sharp permutation groups is widely open.

Finally, we use the opportunity to mention a related result by Bochert~\cite{Bochert} where the divisibility relation of $|G|$ is replaced by an inequality. As usual $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to $x\in\mathbb{R}$.

\begin{Theorem}[Bochert]
If $G$ is primitive, then $|G|\le n(n-1)\ldots(n-\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1)$ unless $G$ is the symmetric group or the alternating group of degree $n$.
\end{Theorem}
