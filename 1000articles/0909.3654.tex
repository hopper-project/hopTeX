\begin{abstract}
Given a knot $K$ in an integral homology sphere ${\Sigma}$ with exterior $N_K$,
there is a natural action of the cyclic group ${{\mathbb Z}}/n$ on the space of ${{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ representations
of the knot group $\pi_1(N_K)$, and this induces an action on the ${{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ character variety.
We identify the fixed points of this action in terms of characters of metabelian representations,
and we apply this to show that the twisted Alexander polynomial $\Delta^{\alpha}_{K,1}(t)$
associated to an irreducible metabelian ${{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$
representation ${\alpha}$ is actually a polynomial in $t^n$.

\section{Introduction}

Suppose $K$ is a knot. Throughout this paper we will always understand this to mean that $K$ is  an oriented simple closed curve in an integral homology 3-sphere ${\Sigma}$.
We write $N_K={\Sigma}^3\smallsetminus \tau(K),$ where $\tau(K)$ denotes an open tubular neighborhood of $K$.

The study of metabelian representations and metabelian quotients of knot groups goes back to the pioneering work of
Neuwirth \cite{Ne65},  de Rham \cite{dRh68}, Burde \cite{Bu67}  and Fox \cite{Fo70}
(see also \cite[Section~14]{BZ03}).
The theory was further developed
by many authors, including Hartley \cite{Ha79,Ha83},  Livingston \cite{Li95}, Letsche \cite{Le00}, Lin \cite{Lin01}, Nagasato
\cite{Na07} and  Jebali \cite{Je08}.
In \cite{BF08} we proved a classification theorem for irreducible metabelian representations,
and in this paper we continue  our study of metabelian representations of knot groups.

We begin by introducing some terminology.
Given a topological space $M$, let $R_n(M)$ be the space
 of ${{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ representations of $\pi_1(M)$   and
 $X_n(M)$ the associated character variety.
 We use $\xi_{\alpha}$ to denote the character of the representation
 ${\alpha} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(M) \to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$. We will often make use of the important fact
 that two irreducible representations
 determine the same character if and only if they are conjugate (see \cite[Corollary 1.33]{LM85}).

Now suppose $K$ is a knot.
There is an action  of the group ${{\mathbb Z}}/n$ on the representation variety
$R_n(N_K)$ given by twisting by the $n$--th roots of unity ${\omega}^k= e^{2 \pi ik/n} \in U(1)$.
(This is a special case of the more general twisting operation described in \cite[Ch. 5]{LM85}.)
More precisely, we write ${{\mathbb Z}}/n = \langle {\sigma} \mid {\sigma}^n=1\rangle$ and
set
$({\sigma} \cdot {\alpha})(g) = {\omega}^{{\varepsilon}(g)} {\alpha}(g)$ for each  $g \in \pi_1(N_K)$,
where ${\varepsilon} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to H_1(N_K) = {{\mathbb Z}}$ is determined by the given orientation of the knot.

This constructs an  action of ${{\mathbb Z}}/n$ on $R_n(N_K)$
which, in turn, descends to an action
on the character variety $X_n(N_K)$.
Our main result identifies the fixed points of
${{\mathbb Z}}/n$ in $X_n^*(N_K)$, the irreducible characters, as those associated to
metabelian representations.

\begin{thm}\label{thm1}
The character $\xi_{\alpha}$ of an irreducible representation  ${\alpha} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ is
fixed under the ${{\mathbb Z}}/n$ action if and only if ${\alpha}$ is metabelian.
\end{thm}

In proving this result, we actually characterize the entire fixed point set  $X_n(N_K)^{{{\mathbb Z}}/n}$
in terms of characters $\xi_{\alpha}$ of the metabelian representations ${\alpha}={\alpha}_{(n,\chi)}$
described in Subsection \ref{sec2-3} (see  Theorem \ref{thm4}).
When $n=2,$ it turns out that every metabelian ${{\rm SL}}(2,{{\mathbb C}})$ representation is dihedral and in this case
Theorem \ref{thm1} was first proved by F. Nagasato and Y. Yamaguchi (cf. \cite[Proposition 4.8]{NY08}).

As an application of Theorem \ref{thm1}, we prove a
result about the twisted Alexander polynomials associated  to metabelian representations.
This result was first shown by C. Herald, P. Kirk and C. Livingston in \cite{HKL08} using completely
different methods. Our approach is elementary and quite natural, and it is explained in Section  \ref{section:twialex}, where we apply it to give an answer
to a question raised by Hirasawa and Murasugi in \cite{HM09}.

\section{The classification of metabelian representations of knot groups}

In this section we recall some results from \cite{BF08}
regarding the classification of metabelian  representations of knot groups.

\subsection{Preliminaries}
Given a group $\pi$, we shall write  $\pi^{(n)}$ for the $n$--th term of the
derived series of $\pi$. These subgroups are defined inductively by setting
$\pi^{(0)}=\pi$ and $\pi^{(i+1)}=[\pi^{(i)},\pi^{(i)}]$.
The group $\pi$ is called \emph{metabelian} if $\pi^{(2)}=\{e\}$.

Suppose $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space over ${{\mathbb C}}$.
A  representation $\varrho {\colon\thinspace} \pi\to {\operatorname{Aut}}(V)$
is called \emph{metabelian}
 if $\varrho$ factors through $\pi/\pi^{(2)}$. The representation $\varrho$ is
 called \emph{reducible}
if there exists a proper subspace $U\subset V$ invariant under $\varrho({\gamma})$ for all ${\gamma}\in  \pi.$
Otherwise $\varrho$ is called \emph{irreducible} or \emph{simple}.
If $\varrho$ is the direct sum of simple representations, then $\varrho$ is called \emph{semisimple}.

Two representations
$\varrho_1 {\colon\thinspace} \pi \to {\operatorname{Aut}}(V)$ and $\varrho_2 {\colon\thinspace} \pi \to {\operatorname{Aut}}(W)$ are called \emph{isomorphic}
if there exists an isomorphism $\phi {\colon\thinspace} V\to W$ such that $\phi^{-1} \circ \varrho_1(g)\circ \phi=\varrho_2(g)$ for all $g\in \pi$.

\subsection{Metabelian quotients of knot groups}\label{section:metabk}

Let $K\subset {\Sigma}^3$ be a knot in an integral homology 3-sphere.
In the following we denote by $\widetilde{N}_K$
the infinite cyclic cover of $N_K$ corresponding to the abelianization $\pi_1(N_K)\to H_1(N_K) \cong {{\mathbb Z}}$.
Therefore $\pi_1(\widetilde{N}_K)=\pi_1(N_K)^{(1)}$ and
$$ H_1(N_K;{{\mathbb Z}}[t^{\pm 1}])=H_1(\widetilde{N}_K) \cong \pi_1(N_K)^{(1)}/\pi_1(N_K)^{(2)}.$$
The ${{\mathbb Z}}[t^{\pm 1}]$--module structure is
given on the right hand side
by $t^n\cdot g:=\mu^{-n}g\mu^n$, where $\mu$ is a meridian
of $K$.

For a knot $K$, we set $\pi:=\pi_1(N_K)$ and consider the short exact sequence
$$ 1\to \pi^{(1)}/\pi^{(2)}\to \pi/\pi^{(2)}\to\pi/\pi^{(1)}\to 1. $$
Since $\pi/\pi^{(1)}=H_1(N_K)\cong {{\mathbb Z}}$, this sequence splits and we get isomorphisms
$$ \begin{array}{rcccl} \pi/\pi^{(2)}
&\cong & \pi/\pi^{(1)} \ltimes \pi^{(1)}/\pi^{(2)}
&\cong &{{\mathbb Z}} \ltimes \pi^{(1)}/\pi^{(2)}   \cong {{\mathbb Z}} \ltimes H_1(N_K;{{\mathbb Z}}[t^{\pm 1}]) \\
    g &\mapsto &(\mu^{{\varepsilon}(g)},\mu^{-{\varepsilon}(g)}g) &\mapsto &({\varepsilon}(g),\mu^{-{\varepsilon}(g)}g), \end{array}  $$
where the semidirect products are taken with respect to the ${{\mathbb Z}}$ actions defined by
letting $n \in {{\mathbb Z}}$ act by conjugation by $\mu^n$ on $\pi^{(1)}/\pi^{(2)}$ and by multiplication
by $t^n$ on $H_1(N_K; {{\mathbb Z}}[t^{\pm1}])$.

\subsection{Irreducible metabelian ${{\rm SL}}(n, {{\mathbb C}})$ representations of knot groups}
\label{sec2-3}
Let $K$ be a knot. We write $H=H_1(N_K;{{\mathbb Z}}[t^{\pm 1}])$.
The discussion of the previous section shows that irreducible metabelian ${{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ representations of $\pi_1(N_K)$ correspond precisely to the irreducible  ${{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ representations of ${{\mathbb Z}}\ltimes H$.

Let
$\chi {\colon\thinspace} H\to {{\mathbb C}}^*$ be a character which factors through $H/(t^n-1)$ and suppose $z\in S^1$ with $z^n=(-1)^{n+1}$. Then it follows from
\cite[Section~3]{BF08} that, for $(j, h) \in {{\mathbb Z}}\ltimes H,$ setting
$$  {\alpha}_{(\chi,z)} (j,h) =
 \begin{pmatrix}
 0& &\dots &z \\
 z&0&\dots &0 \\
\vdots &\ddots &\ddots&\vdots \\
     0&\dots &z &0 \end{pmatrix}^j
     \begin{pmatrix} \chi(h) &0&\dots &0 \\
 0&\chi(th) &\dots &0 \\
\vdots &&\ddots &\vdots \\ 0&0&\dots &\chi(t^{n-1}h) \end{pmatrix}
$$
defines an  ${{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ representation whose isomorphism type of this representation does not depend on the choice of $z$.
In our notation we will not normally
distinguish between metabelian representations
of $\pi_1(N_K)$ and representations of $ {{\mathbb Z}} \ltimes H$.

In the following we say that a character $\chi {\colon\thinspace} H\to {{\mathbb C}}^*$ has \emph{order $n$} if
it factors through $H/(t^n-1)$, but not through $H/(t^\ell-1)$ for any $\ell < n$.
 Given a character  $\chi {\colon\thinspace} H\to {{\mathbb C}}^*$, let $t^i\chi$ be the character defined by $(t^i\chi)(h)=\chi(t^ih)$.
Any character $\chi {\colon\thinspace} H\to {{\mathbb C}}^*$ which factors through $H/(t^n-1)$ must have order $k$ for some
divisor $k$ of $n$.
The following is a combination of \cite[Lemma~2.2]{BF08} and  \cite[Theorem~3.3]{BF08}.

\begin{thm} \label{thm2}
Suppose  $\chi {\colon\thinspace} H  \to {{\mathbb C}}^*$ is a character that factors through $H/(t^n-1)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] ${\alpha}_{(n,\chi)}{\colon\thinspace} {{\mathbb Z}}\ltimes H\to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ is irreducible if and only if the character $\chi$ has order $n$.
\item[(ii)] Given two characters $\chi,\chi'{\colon\thinspace} H\to {{\mathbb C}}^*$ of order $n$, the representations
${\alpha}_{(n,\chi)}$ and ${\alpha}_{(n,\chi')}$ are conjugate if and only if $\chi=t^k\chi'$ for some $k$.
\item[(iii)] For any irreducible representation  ${\alpha} {\colon\thinspace}{{\mathbb Z}}\ltimes H\to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$
 there exists a character $\chi {\colon\thinspace} H\to {{\mathbb C}}^*$ of order $n$ such that
${\alpha}$ is conjugate to ${\alpha}_{(n,\chi)}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\section{Main results}
\subsection{Metabelian characters as fixed points}

Set ${\omega} = e^{2 \pi i/n}$ and recall the action
of the cyclic group ${{\mathbb Z}}/n =\langle {\sigma} \mid {\sigma}^n=1\rangle$ on
 representations ${\alpha} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ obtained by
  setting $({\sigma} \cdot {\alpha})(g)= {\omega}^{{\varepsilon}(g)} {\alpha}(g)$ for all $g \in \pi_1(N_K),$
where ${\varepsilon} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to H_1(N_K)={{\mathbb Z}}$.

We begin with the following  lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem3}
Suppose ${\alpha} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ is a representation
whose associated character $\xi_{\alpha} \in X_n(N_K)$ is a fixed point
of the ${{\mathbb Z}}/n$ action. Then up to conjugation,
we have
\begin{equation} \label{eq2}
{\alpha}(\mu) =
\begin{pmatrix} 0& &\dots &z \\
z&0&\dots &0 \\
\vdots &\ddots &\ddots&\vdots \\
     0&\dots &z &0 \end{pmatrix},
     \end{equation}
for some (in fact any) $z \in U(1)$ such that $z^{n}=(-1)^{n+1}.$\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $c(t) = \det ({\alpha}(\mu)-tI)$ denote the characteristic polynomial
of ${\alpha}(\mu),$ which we can write as
$$c(t) = (-1)^n t^n + c_{n-1} t^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 t +1.$$
Note that $c(t)$ is determined by the character $\xi_{\alpha} \in X_n(N_K)$,
and so assuming $\xi_{\alpha}$ is a fixed point of the ${{\mathbb Z}}/n$ action, we conclude that
${\alpha}(\mu)$ and ${\omega}^k {\alpha}(\mu)$ have the same characteristic polynomials for all $k$.
In particular,
\begin{eqnarray*}
c(t)&=&\det({\alpha}(\mu)-tI)\\
&=&\det ({\omega}^{-1} {\alpha}(\mu)-tI) \\
&=& \det ({\omega}^{-1} {\alpha}(\mu)-({\omega}^{-1} {\omega})tI)\\
&=&\det ({\omega}^{-1} I) \det ({\alpha}(\mu)- {\omega} tI) \\
&=&  \det ({\alpha}(\mu)-t {\omega} I) = c({\omega} t).
\end{eqnarray*}
However, ${\omega}^k \neq 1$ unless $n | k$, and this implies
$0=c_{n-1}=c_{n-2} = \cdots = c_1$ and $c(t) = (-1)^n t^n +1.$
In particular the matrix ${\alpha}(\mu)$ and the matrix appearing in
Equation (\ref{eq2}) have the same set of $n$ distinct eigenvalues. This implies that the two matrices are conjugate.
\end{proof}

In order to prove Theorem \ref{thm1}, we establish the following more
general result.
\begin{thm} \label{thm4}
The fixed point set  of the ${{\mathbb Z}}/n$ action on $X_n(N_K)$
consists of characters $\xi_{\alpha}$ of the metabelian representations
${\alpha} = {\alpha}_{(n,\chi)}$ described in Section \ref{sec2-3}. In other words,
$$X_n(N_K)^{{{\mathbb Z}}/n} = \{ \xi_{\alpha} \mid {\alpha} ={\alpha}_{(n,\chi)} \text{ for } \chi {\colon\thinspace} H_1(N_K; {{\mathbb Z}}[t^{\pm 1}]) \to {{\mathbb C}}^*\}.$$
\end{thm}

Notice that Theorem~\ref{thm1} can be viewed as the
special case of Theorem \ref{thm4} where
${\alpha}$ is irreducible. (Recall that irreducible representations are conjugate if and only if they define the same character.)
Notice further that not every reducible metabelian
representation is of the form ${\alpha}_{(n,\chi)}$.

\begin{proof}

We first show that if ${\alpha} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ is given as ${\alpha} = {\alpha}_{(n,\chi)},$
then ${\sigma} \cdot {\alpha}$ is conjugate to ${\alpha}$. This of course implies that $\xi_{\alpha} = \xi_{{\sigma} \cdot {\alpha}}$.

Assume then that ${\alpha} = {\alpha}_{(n,\chi)}.$
Then we have $${\alpha}(\mu) =\begin{pmatrix}
0& \dots& &z \\
z& 0&\dots&0 \\
\vdots &\ddots &\ddots&\vdots \\
     0&\dots &z &0 \end{pmatrix},$$
     where $z$ satisfies $z^{n}= (-1)^{n+1}.$
Further, ${\alpha}(g)$ is diagonal for all $g\in [\pi_1(N_K), \pi_1(N_K)]$.
By definition of ${\sigma} \cdot {\alpha},$ we  see that
$$({\sigma}\cdot{\alpha}) (\mu) = {\omega} {\alpha}(\mu)=
\begin{pmatrix} 0& \dots &&{\omega} z \\
{\omega} z &0&\dots &0 \\
\vdots &\ddots &\ddots&\vdots \\
     0&\dots &{\omega} z &0 \end{pmatrix}$$
     and that $({\sigma} \cdot {\alpha})(g) = {\alpha}(g)$
     for all $g \in [\pi_1(N_K), \pi_1(N_K)]$.
It follows easily  from Theorem \ref{thm2} (2)
that ${\sigma} \cdot {\alpha}$ and ${\alpha}_{(n,\chi)}$ are conjugate;
however it is easy to see this directly too.
Simply take   $$P = \begin{pmatrix} 1&&& 0 \\
 &{\omega} \\
&&\ddots  \\
     0&&&{\omega}^{n-1} \end{pmatrix},$$
     and compute that
     ${\sigma} \cdot {\alpha} =P {\alpha} P^{-1}$ as claimed.

We now show the other implication, namely that each point
$\xi \in X_n(N_K)^{{{\mathbb Z}}/n}$ in the fixed point set
can be represented as the character $\xi=\xi_{\alpha}$
of a metabelian representation ${\alpha} = {\alpha}_{(n,\chi)},$
where $\chi {\colon\thinspace} H_1(N_K; {{\mathbb Z}}[t^{\pm 1}]) \to {{\mathbb C}}^*$
is a character that factors through $H_1(N_K; {{\mathbb Z}}[t^{\pm 1}])/(t^n-1)$,
hence has order $k$ for some $k$ dividing $n$.
(Note that Theorem \ref{thm2} (1) tells us that
${\alpha}_{(n,\chi)}$ is irreducible if and only
if $\chi$ has order $n$.)

By the general results on representation spaces and character varieties (see \cite{LM85}),
it follows that every point in the character variety $X_n(N_K)$ can be represented
as $\xi_{\alpha}$ for some semisimple representation ${\alpha} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$.
Further, two semisimple representations ${\alpha}_1$ and ${\alpha}_2$
determine the same character if and only if ${\alpha}_1$ is conjugate to ${\alpha}_2.$
(This is evident from the fact that the orbits of the semisimple representations under conjugation
are closed.)

Given $\xi \in X_n(N_K)^{{{\mathbb Z}}/n}$,
we can therefore suppose that $\xi=\xi_{\alpha}$ for some semisimple representation ${\alpha}$.
Clearly ${\sigma} \cdot {\alpha}$ is also semisimple, and
since $\xi_{\alpha} = \xi_{{\sigma} \cdot {\alpha}}$, we conclude from the above that ${\alpha}$ and ${\sigma} \cdot {\alpha}$
are conjugate representations. This means  that there exists a matrix $A  \in {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$
such that $A {\alpha} A^{-1} = {\sigma} \cdot {\alpha}$,
in other words, for all $g\in \pi_1(N_K),$ we have
\begin{equation} \label{eq2} A {\alpha}(g) A^{-1} = {\omega}^{{\varepsilon}(g)} {\alpha}(g).\end{equation}
Lemma \ref{lem3} implies
${\alpha}(\mu)$ is conjugate to  the matrix in Equation (\ref{eq2}).
It is convenient to conjugate ${\alpha}$ so that ${\alpha}(\mu)$ is diagonal,
meaning that
$${\alpha}(\mu)= \begin{pmatrix} z&&& 0 \\
 &{\omega} z  \\
&&\ddots  \\
     0&&&{\omega}^{n-1} z \end{pmatrix},
$$
where $z$ satisfies $z^n=(-1)^{n+1}$.

We now apply (\ref{eq2}) to the meridian to conclude that
$$A {\alpha}(\mu) = {\omega} {\alpha}(\mu) A,$$
 which implies
$A = (a_{ij})$ satisfies $a_{ij}=0$ unless $j = i+1 \mod(n).$
Thus, we see that
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 0&{\lambda}_1&0& \dots &0 \\
0&0&{\lambda}_2&\dots &0 \\
 \vdots& \vdots & \ddots& \ddots &\vdots \\
 0&0&\dots&0&{\lambda}_{n-1}\\
 {\lambda}_n & 0 & \dots &0 &0
\end{pmatrix}$$
for some ${\lambda}_1, \ldots, {\lambda}_n$ satisfying ${\lambda}_1 \cdots {\lambda}_n = (-1)^{n+1}.$

It is completely straightforward to see that the characteristic polynomial of
$A$ is given by
$$\det (A-tI) =
(-1)^n(t^n - (-1)^{n+1}).$$
From this, we conclude that $A$ has as its eigenvalues the
$n$ distinct $n$--th roots of $(-1)^{n+1}.$ In particular, the subset of ${{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$
of matrices that commute with $A$ is just a copy of the unique maximal torus
$T_A \cong ({{\mathbb C}}^*)^{n-1}$ containing $A$.

For any $g \in [\pi_1(N_K), \pi_1(N_K)]$, we have
${\alpha}(g) = ({\sigma} \cdot {\alpha})(g)$. Thus it follows that
$A {\alpha}(g) A^{-1} = {\alpha}(g),$ and this implies that ${\alpha}(g) \in T_A$ for
all $g \in [\pi_1(N_K), \pi_1(N_K)]$. This shows that
the restriction of ${\alpha}$ to the commutator subgroup
$[\pi_1(N_K), \pi_1(N_K)]$ is abelian, and we conclude from this that
${\alpha}$ is indeed metabelian. Notice that this, and an application of  Theorem \ref{thm2} (3),
completes the proof in the case ${\alpha}$ is irreducible.

In the general case, it follows from the discussion in Section  \ref{section:metabk} that
${\alpha}$ factors through ${{\mathbb Z}}\ltimes H_1(N_K;{{\mathbb Z}}[t^{\pm 1}])$.
Let $H =  H_1(N_K;{{\mathbb Z}}[t^{\pm 1}])$.
Given a character $\chi {\colon\thinspace} H\to{{\mathbb C}}^*$ we define the associated weight space $V_\chi$ by setting
$$V_{\chi}=\{ v\in {{\mathbb C}}^n \, |\, \chi(h)\cdot v={\alpha}(h)v \text{ for all }h\in H\}.$$
Recall that  $A\cdot {\alpha}(h)\cdot A^{-1}={\alpha}(h)$ for any $h\in H$. It is straightforward so show that $A$ restricts to an automorphism of $V_\chi$.
Since $H$ is abelian there exists at least one character $\chi{\colon\thinspace} H\to {{\mathbb C}}^*$ such that
$V_{\chi}$ is non--trivial. For any $i$ we denote by $t^i\chi$ the character given by $(t^i\chi)(h)=\chi(t^i h), h\in H$.

Note that $A$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues and therefore is diagonalizable.
Since $A$ restricts to an automorphism of $V_\chi$, there is an
eigenvector $v$ of $A$ which lies in $V_{\chi}$. Let ${\lambda}$ be the corresponding eigenvalue. By the proof of \cite[Theorem~2.3]{BF08},
the map ${\alpha}(\mu)$ induces an isomorphism $V_{\chi}\to V_{t\chi}$.
We now calculate
\[ A\cdot {\alpha}(\mu)  v=(A{\alpha}(\mu)A^{-1})\cdot Av={\omega} {\alpha}(\mu) \cdot {\lambda} v={\lambda} {\omega} \cdot {\alpha}(\mu)v,\]
i.e.  ${\alpha}(\mu) v \in V_{t\chi}$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue ${\omega} {\lambda}$.

Iterating this argument, we see that ${\alpha}(\mu)^iv$ lies in $V_{t^i\chi}$ and is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue ${\omega}^i {\lambda}$.
Since ${\omega}$ is a primitive $n$--th root of unity, the eigenvalues ${\lambda},{\omega} {\lambda},\dots,{\omega}^{n-1}{\lambda}$ are all distinct, and this implies that
the corresponding eigenvectors $v, {\alpha}(\mu)v, \dots, {\alpha}(\mu)^{n-1}v$  form a basis for ${{\mathbb C}}^n$.

Let $m$ be the order of $\chi$, i.e. $m$ is the minimal number such that $\chi=t^m\chi$.
By the above we see that ${{\mathbb C}}^n$ is generated by $V_{\chi}, V_{t \chi}, \dots,V_{t^m\chi}$.
Since the characters $\chi, t\chi, \dots,t^m\chi$ are pairwise distinct, it follows  that  ${{\mathbb C}}^n$ is given as the direct sum $V_{\chi}\oplus V_{t\chi}\oplus \dots \oplus V_{t^{m-1}\chi}$.

We write $k=\dim_{{\mathbb C}}(V_{\chi})$ and note that $n=km$. We note further that ${\alpha}(\mu)^m$ has   eigenvalues given by the set
\begin{equation}\label{eq3}
\{z^m,z^me^{2\pi i/k},\dots,z^me^{2\pi i(k-1)/k}\},
\end{equation}
and each eigenvalue has multiplicity $m$.
Clearly ${\alpha}(\mu)^m$ restricts to an automorphism of $V_{t^i\chi}$ for $i=0,\dots,m -1$, and
equally clearly we see that the restrictions all give conjugate representations.
This implies that the restriction of ${\alpha}(\mu)^m$ to $V_{\chi}$ has  eigenvalues in the
set (\ref{eq3}) above, each occurring with multiplicity $1$.
In particular we can find a basis
 $\{v_1,\dots,v_k\}$  for $V_\chi$ in which the matrix of ${\alpha}(\mu)^m$ has the form
 $${\alpha}(\mu^m) =\begin{pmatrix}
0& \dots& &z^m \\
z^m& 0&\dots&0 \\
\vdots &\ddots &\ddots&\vdots \\
     0&\dots &z^m &0 \end{pmatrix}.$$
It is now straightforward to verify that with respect to the ordered basis
$$\left\{ \begin{array}{cccc}
v_1,&z^{-1}{\alpha}(\mu)v_1,&\dots,&z^{-(m-1)}{\alpha}(\mu)^{m-1}v_1,\\
v_2,&z^{-1}{\alpha}(\mu)v_2,&\dots,&z^{-(m-1)}{\alpha}(\mu)^{m-1}v_2,\\
\vdots &\vdots &\dots& \vdots \\
v_k,&z^{-1}{\alpha}(\mu)w_k,&\dots,&z^{-(m-1)}{\alpha}(\mu)^{m-1}v_k\end{array}\right\} ,$$
${\alpha}$ is given by ${\alpha}(n,\chi)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Application to twisted Alexander polynomials}\label{section:twialex}
As an application, we now prove the following result regarding twisted Alexander polynomials of knots
corresponding to metabelian representations.
In the following, we use  $\Delta^{\alpha}_{K,i}(t)$ to denote the $i$--th twisted Alexander
polynomial for a given representation ${\alpha} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ as presented
in \cite{FV09}.

\begin{prop} \label{prop5}
Let ${\alpha}$ be  a metabelian  representation of the form
${\alpha}={\alpha}_{(n,\chi)} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$. Then
\[  \Delta^{\alpha}_{K,0}(t) =\left\{ \begin{array}{rl} 1-t^n, &\mbox{ if $\chi$ is trivial}, \\ 1,& \mbox{ otherwise.}\end{array} \right.\]
Furthermore
the twisted Alexander polynomial
 $\Delta^{\alpha}_{K,1}(t)$ is actually a polynomial
in $t^n.$
\end{prop}

\begin{remark}
In their paper \cite{HKL08},  C. Herald, P. Kirk, and C. Livingston
prove the same result using an entirely different approach (cf. p.~10 of \cite{HKL08}).
We also point out that Proposition \ref{prop5} gives a positive answer to Conjecture A from a
recent paper by M. Hirasawa and K. Murasugi (see  \cite{HM09}).
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
The proof of the first statement is not difficult. It is immediate
when $\chi$ is trivial, and it follows by a direct calculation when
 $\chi$ is non--trivial.

We now turn to the proof of the second statement.
For ${\theta} \in U(1)$ and any representation
${\beta}:ï¿½\pi_1(N_K) \to {{\rm GL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$, define the ${\theta}$-twist of ${\beta}$
to be the representation sending $g \in \pi_1(N_K)$ to
${\theta}^{{\varepsilon}(g)} {\beta}(g),$ where ${\varepsilon}{\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to {{\mathbb Z}}$ is
 determined by the orientation of $K$.
We denote the newly obtained representation
by ${\beta}_{\theta} {\colon\thinspace} \pi_1(N_K) \to {{\rm GL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$.
Note that in case ${\alpha}:ï¿½\pi_1(N_K) \to {{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ and
${\theta}= e^{2 \pi ik/n}$ is an $n$-th root of unity,
${\alpha}_{\theta}$ is again an ${{\rm SL}}(n,{{\mathbb C}})$ representation.
The proof of the proposition relies on the
formula
\begin{equation} \label{eq4}
\Delta_{K,1}^{{\beta}_{\theta}}(t) = \Delta_{K,1}^{\beta}({\theta} t).
\end{equation}
This formula is well-known and follows directly from the definition of the twisted Alexander
polynomial.
Equation (\ref{eq4}) combines with Theorem \ref{thm1} to complete the proof, as we now explain.
Take ${\omega} = e^{2 \pi i/n}$. If ${\alpha}={\alpha}_{(n,\chi)}$ is metabelian,
then Theorem \ref{thm1} shows that its conjugacy class is fixed under the ${{\mathbb Z}}/n$
action. In particular, since ${\alpha}$ and ${\alpha}_{\omega}$ are
conjugate, Equation (\ref{eq4}) shows that
$$\Delta^{\alpha}_{K,1}(t) =ï¿½\Delta^{{\alpha}_{\omega}}_{K,1}(t)=ï¿½\Delta^{\alpha}_{K,1}({\omega} t).$$
Expanding
$\Delta^{\alpha}_{K,1}(t)= \sum a_i t^i$
and using the fact that $t^k = ({\omega} t)^k$ if and only if $k$ is a multiple
of $n$,
this shows that $a_k =0$ unless $k$ is a
multiple of $n$ and this completes the proof.
\end{proof}
